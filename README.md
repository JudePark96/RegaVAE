## Model Architecture
![](architecture.png)
Architecture of RegaVAE. Based on the training data, we first train a VAE to construct a compact latent space, which ensures that the latent variable z contains both current and future information (see ยง 3.1 of the paper). We then build a retrieval database and then aggregate the retrieved information into the generator (see ยง 3.2 of the paper). VAE Encoder and Decoder parameters are the same in all steps. In order to ensure fairness, the Corpus data and the Source data in the training set are the same. $G$ represents the Gaussian mixture distribution, and $ฯ$ is the corresponding parameter.
